# Theory of Main Concepts

## Mean-Variance Optimization
Mean-variance optimization is a process that aims to create a portfolio with the highest expected return for a given level of risk. It involves calculating the expected returns, variances, and covariances of the portfolio's assets and then finding the optimal weights that maximize the portfolio's Sharpe or Sortino ratio.

## GARCH Volatility Forecasting
The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is used to forecast the volatility of asset returns. The GARCH model captures the time-varying nature of volatility, which helps in better risk management and portfolio optimization.

## Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in financial, project management, and other forecasting models. By simulating a large number of possible outcomes, we can estimate the probability distribution of the portfolio's future returns.

## Backtesting
Backtesting involves testing a trading strategy or portfolio optimization technique using historical data. It helps in assessing the effectiveness of the strategy and understanding how it would have performed in the past.
